        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p> My main focus is with digital entertainment and interactive media arts. Mostly videogames and animations, my goal is to become a lead designer or art director.
            I am always looking for ways to hone my craft and temper my mind, trying new things and learning new ways to draw. I am not very adept with computers, but I 
            am willing to learn.
